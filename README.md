# attention_layer_tf_keras

This Layer is inspired by [tensorflow/official/model/model/attention_layer.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/3fca8afe7eaaaa845b803ab7951ee3f3ed235208/official/transformer/model/attention_layer.py)

I try to rewrite it as a tf.keras layer

Original paper is [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
